                <h5>First rehearsal back after Concert, Apr 25, 2022</h5>
                <div class="fakeimg" id="welcome-back" style="height:200px;"></div>
                <p class="news">After the outstanding success of our inaugural concert last month, 
                    we restarted our rehearsals today with everyone very keen to play together again. 
                    it was great to catch up, reflect on the concert and see everyone, athough unfortunately Jacob Smith will no longer be conducting for us. <br><br> Over the next few months, we will be working on the BBC's 40 pieces,
                    an ambitious initiative which aims to open up the world of classical music 
                    to a generation of children and adults. For now, we will be focusing on <em>Doctor Who Theme </em>
                    , <em>Symphony No.9 in E minor, 'From the New World' - Largo</em> by Dvořák, i.e. the Hovis Theme, 
                    <em>The Hungarian Dance</em> by Brahms, and <em>Habanera</em> and the fiendish <em>Toreador</em>
                    from <em>Carmen Suite No.2</em> by Bizet. <br><br>Through these pieces, we look forward to learning about 
                    new and exciting features of classical music. We hope to perform a selection of these pieces in our next concert in October 2022 (more info soon!).

                <h2>Inaugural Concert</h2>
                <h5>First ChromaMusic Community Concert, Mar 19, 2022</h5>
                <div class="fakeimg" id="inaugural-concert" style="height:200px;"></div>
                <p class="news">
                    To mark the second anniversary of the lockdown of March 2020, we wanted to hold an event to help people work 
                    through the emotions created by the pandemic and lockdowns. So we commissioned a new musical work from Llanelli-based composer <a href="https://www.composerjacobsmith.com/" target="_blank">Jacob Smith.</a> 
                    This was a fantastic three movement concerto for orchestra and four soloists, called Reflections. <br><br>
                    As well as Reflections, the concert also featured ChromaMusic Cello Club, solos by Melody Angelicus and James McBeth, and six short pieces by <a href="https://www.llanellicommunitywindband.org/" target="_blank">Llanelli Wind Band</a>. <br><br>
                    Here are some lovely comments we had at the end of the night! <br><br>

                    <em>“Just to say how much I enjoyed the concert on Saturday. It was very emotional from the very beginning with the 
                    Ukrainian National Anthem, the Soloists, Bethan and Melody and ending up with Reminiscence, Remembrance and Rebirth. 
                    It was very sad at times but the Rebirth at the end was so uplifting that I did not want it to end.”</em><br><br>

                    <em>“The piece should be heard around the world.”</em><br><br>

                    <em>“It was a wonderful piece, I think it should be played by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales”</em>
