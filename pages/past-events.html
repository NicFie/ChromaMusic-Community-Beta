                    To mark the second anniversary of the lockdown of March 2020, we wanted to hold an event to help people work 
                    through the emotions created by the pandemic and lockdowns. So we commissioned a new musical work from Llanelli-based composer <a href="https://www.composerjacobsmith.com/" target="_blank">Jacob Smith.</a>
                    This was a fantastic three movement concerto for orchestra and four soloists, called Reflections. <br><br>
                    Reflections is based on the themes of Reminiscence, Remembrance and Rebirth. <br><br> <strong>Reminiscence </strong>takes us back to a time before March 2020 
                    and the onset of the pandemic and lockdowns. A time before face masks, social distancing, zoom and sanitising. This first movement has a festive feel and is reminiscent of happy, family times.<br>
                    <br><strong>Remembrance</strong> brings us into the feelings of isolation and anxiety as we came to terms with the restrictions and Covid 19, 
                    and then leads into a beautiful soprano solo where we can remember those who we have lost during this time. 
                    It includes some ingenius instrumental techniques, such as random string plucking to represent the spread of the virus, and the wind and brass blowing through their instruments, representing laboured breathing.<br>
                    <br><strong>Rebirth</strong> looks to the future with hope as we go forward changed but not defeated. The soprano revisits the tune from the second movement but now it’s in the bright major key representing our continuing hope for the future.<br><br>
                    As well as Reflections, the concert also featured <em>Time</em> by Hans Zimmer, played by ChromaMusic Cello Club, 
                    <em>The Robin</em> written and performed by Melody Angelicus and <em>Cassado's Cello Suite: 3rd Movement</em>, played by James McBeth.
                    We were supported by the <a href="https://www.llanellicommunitywindband.org/" target="_blank">Llanelli Wind Band</a>, who played six short pieces. <br><br>
                    We secured partial funding from Ty Cerdd and Llwchwr Town Council to put on a concert and develop a community training orchestra, where people could develop their skills under expert tuition.
                    This was also an excellent opportunity for local young musicians to gain experience at the start of their careers. 
                    Jacob Smith is a film composer from Llanelli, James McBeth is a cellist from Pontarddulais, Cathryn Jenkins is a viola player from Pontardawe, and Bethan Evans is a soprano from Bishopston. <br><br>
                    <em>“Just to say how much I enjoyed the concert on Saturday. It was very emotional from the very beginning with the 
                    Ukrainian National Anthem, the Soloists, Bethan and Melody and ending up with Reminiscence, Remembrance and Rebirth. 
                    It was very sad at times but the Rebirth at the end was so uplifting that I did not want it to end.”</em><br><br>

                    <em>“The piece should be heard around the world.”</em><br><br>

                    <em>“It was a wonderful piece, I think it should be played by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales”</em> <br>
